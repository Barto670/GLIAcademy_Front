1) First of all nodejs is required to be able to install angular and all the required packages,
   it can be downloaded from here: https://nodejs.org/en/

2) After NodeJs is installed a system restart will be needed

3) Open Command Prompt and type 'npm install -g @angular/cli' in order to install a global Angular instance

4) If Angular installed correctly move on to the next step if it didnt using an older vesion of NodeJs can fix the issue,
   like v14

5) Navigate to the 'frontend' folder with command prompt and type 'npm install' , 
this will install a local instance of Angular specifically for this frontend instance

6) While staying in the same directory run 'ng serve' , after this completes the frontend application will be running.

7) The frontend website can be accesed by the browser using localhost:4200 or 127.0.0.1:4200

8) If not done already follow the steps of the backend because the website is not fully functional without both backend and frontend
